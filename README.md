# Readme

This is extra credit (so not "required"). There are 2 problems, and both problems are a little trickier (though still doable) and we highly recommend you at least give them a try!

If you have questions about this lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/ExtraCredit.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `ExtraCredit`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Extra-Credit.ipynb` notebook. 

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Completing the Lab

You can modify `Extra-Credit.ipynb`. Add your own cells, but don't delete the original problems - this helps us match up your answers to each exercise and check that you did all of the work. Don't forget to rename your lab -> `<pitt username>-Extra-Credit.ipynb` where the <pitt username> is your username. For example, if my username is abc123, I would rename the lab to `abc123-Extra-Credit.ipynb`.

Like all of the other labs, this lab is worth 1 point, unlike other labs, this is out of 0 points. So it is worth a full extra lab.

## Submitting your lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, if you used the SCI JupyterHub, Virtual Lab, or Binder, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class
    * Go to Assignments
    * Click on the Skills Lab assignment for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you saved/created/downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!

If you are confused, here is a [tutorial](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-as-an-assignment-submission-in-Canvas/ta-p/274) on how to submit an assignment on Canvas.

**Note:** you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
