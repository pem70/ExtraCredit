    "You're going to improve this program, using what you learned in chapters 4 and 5. You're going to make three major changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rewrite the program **using a function** called `computegrade()`. Define that function so that it takes the score (between 0 and 100) as an **argument** and returns the grade as a string.   \n",
    "    You can do the return one of two ways: either the function `computegrade()` can print out the letter grade, or by using a return statement: for example, `return \"A\"`. If you use a return statement, you're going to have to print it out in the main block of your program. That'll look something like this: `print(\"Grade:\", computegrade(score))`  \n",
    "    Using return statements is theoretically the \"better\" way to do this problem, but it is quite a bit more difficult, so consider that a challenge if you want to do it that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `try` and `except`, **allow the user** to enter either an int *or* a float for the score. If you've already done that in last week's assignment, congratulations, you're awesome! Pat yourself on the back.  \n",
    "![pat yourself on the back](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oFzmbl7X4uIyj2wrm/giphy.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Here's the real hard part: you're going to let the user enter as many grades as they want. You're going to want to put the code that asks the user for a grade in an *infinite while loop* so it executes as many times as the user wants.   \n",
    "    If the user enters a number less than 0 or greater than 100, use a `break` statement to quit the loop and exit the program. This means that you're going to want to test whether or not the score entered is between 0 and 100 *before* you call `computegrade(score)`.\n",
